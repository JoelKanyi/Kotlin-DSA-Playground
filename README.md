## 8 Common Data Structures
### 1. Arrays
An array is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays (such as 2-dimensional arrays). Arrays are indexed, meaning that random access is possible.

#### Types of Arrays
- One-Dimensional Arrays: Elements are stored in a continuous memory location (You can imagine a 1d array as a row, where elements are stored one after another).
- Multi-Dimensional Arrays:
  - Two-Dimensional Arrays - You can imagine it like a table where each cell contains elements (store elements in rows and columns format).
  - Three Dimensional Arrays - You can imagine it like a cuboid made up of smaller cube with rows, columns, and depth as the third dimension.

#### Array operations
- Traverse - go through the elements
- Search - Search for an element in the array (by value or its index)
- Update - Update the value of an existing element at a given index
- Insertion − Adds an element at the given index.
- Deletion − Deletes an element at the given index.
- Sorting - Arrange elements in increasing or decreasing order.
- Merging - Merge two sorted arrays into a larger sorted array.
- Order statistics - Find the `kth` smallest/largest element in an array.

> Note: Implementation of the operations are in the `data_structures` package
